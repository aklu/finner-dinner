<h2>Schedule</h2>
<p>Currently, Finn goes on a walk after eating in the morning for about 20 minutes. The time doesn't matter too much, but he definitely needs to poop.</p>
<p>I usually take him out to go potty and sniff around in the backyard around lunch time. But whatever works with your schedule!</p>
<p>After he eats dinner, I take him on a long walk or to the dog park. We usually walk for at least 30-45 minutes and I try to shoot for an hour walk - or until he looks tired-ish. He almost always poops on this walk.</p>
