  </ul>

<h2>Snacking</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>If Finn seems super hungy or is begging for more food, you can give him a handful of frozen green beans in the freezer. He is on a strict diet from his Vet, but the green beans are virtually no calories and help him feel full. Winner winner, green bean snack?!</li>
    <li>You can also give him some treats if you think he is being an extra good boy. They are above the stove, on the shelf.</li>
  </ul>

<h2>Before Bed BullyStick</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Best not to google what this is</li>
  <li>Before bed, and after you let Finn out to pee, please give him a frozen BullyStick from the freezer!</li>
</ul>
